# Playground
This repository is a showcase of various experiments with HTML, JS, CSS and LLM. It's a place where I can test out new ideas and concepts or tools or just have fun with code.

## Tools

### 1. URL Encode/Decode Tool

This tool allows you to encode and decode URLs. It's useful for converting URLs into a format that can be transmitted over the Internet.
